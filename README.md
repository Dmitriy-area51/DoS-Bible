# DoS-Bible


| OSI Layer| Protocol Data Unit (PDU)|Layer Description|Protocols|Examples of Denial of Service Techniques at Each Level | Potential Impact of DoS Attack|Mitigation Options for Attack Type|
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
|Application Layer (7)|Data|Message and packet creation begins. DB access is on this level. End-user protocols such as FTP, SMTP, Telnet, and RAS work in this layer.|Uses the Protocols FTP, HTTP, POP3, & SMTP and its device is the Gateway|PDF GET requests, HTTP GET, HTTP POST, = website forms (login, uploading photo/video, submitting feedback)|Reach resource limits of services Resource starvation|Application monitoring is the practice of monitoring software applications using dedicated set of algorithms, technologies, and approaches to detect zero day and application layer (Layer 7 attacks). Once identified these attacks can be stopped and traced back to a specific source more easily than other types of DDoS attacks.|
|Presentation Layer (6)|Data|Translates the data format from sender to receiver.|Use the Protocols Compression & Encryption|Malformed SSL Requests – Inspecting SSL encryption packets is resource intensive. Attackers use SSL to tunnel HTTP attacks to target the server|The affected systems could stop accepting SSL connections or automatically restart|To mitigate, consider options like offloading the SSL from the origin infrastructure and inspecting the application traffic for signs of attacks traffic or violations of policy at an applications delivery platform (ADP). A good ADP will also ensure that your traffic is then re-encrypted and forwarded back to the origin infrastructure with unencrypted content only ever residing in protected memory on a secure bastion host.|
|Session (5)|Data|Governs establishment, termination, and sync of session within the OS over the network (ex: when you log off and on)|Use the Protocol Logon/Logoff|Telnet DDoS-attacker exploits a flaw in a Telnet server software running on the switch, rendering Telnet services unavailable|Prevents administrator from performing switch management functions|Check with your hardware provider to determine if there’s a version update or patch to mitigate the vulnerability|
|Transport (4)|Segment|Ensures error-free transmission between hosts: manages transmission of messages from layers 1 through 3|Uses the Protocols TCP & UDP|SYN Flood, Smurf Attack|Reach bandwidth or connection limits of hosts or networking equipment|DDoS attack blocking, commonly referred to as blackholing, is a method typically used by ISPs to stop a DDoS attack on one of its customers. This approach to block DDoS attacks makes the site in question completely inaccessible to all traffic, both malicious attack traffic and legitimate user traffic. Black holding is typically deployed by the ISP to protect other customers on its network from the adverse effects of DDoS attacks such as slow network performance and disrupted service|
|Network (3)|Packet|Dedicated to routing and switching information to different networks. LAN or internetworks|Uses the Protocols IP, ICMP, ARP, & RIP and uses Routers as its device|ICMP Flooding – A Layer 3 infrastructure DDoS attack method that uses ICMP messages to overload the targeted network’s bandwidth|Can affect available network bandwidth and impose extra load on the firewall|Rate-limit ICMP traffic and prevent the attack from impacting bandwidth and firewall performance
|Data Link (2)|Frame|Establishes, maintains, and decides how the transfer is accomplished over the physical layer|Uses the Protocols 802.3 & 802.5 and it’s devices are NICs, switches bridges & WAPs|MAC flooding – inundates the network switch with data packets|Disrupts the usual sender to recipient flow of data – blasting across all ports|Many advances switches can be configured to limit the number of MAC addresses that can be learned on ports connected to end stations; allow discovered MAC addresses to be authenticated against an authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) server and subsequently filtered|
|Physical (1)|Bits|Includes, but not limited to cables, jacks, and hubs|Uses the Protocols 100 Base-T & 1000 Base-X and uses Hubs, patch panels, & RJ45 Jacks as devices|Physical destruction, obstruction, manipulation, or malfunction of physical assets|Physical assets will become unresponsive and may need to be repaired to increase availability|Practice defense in-depth tactics, use access controls, accountability, and auditing to track and control physical assets|
